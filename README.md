# RISCify
ABSTRACT:
RISCify is a simulator that is built using python runs programs of the RISC-V architecture. RISCify can read and execute files containing assembly language. RISCify is a self-contained system for running these programs and contains a debugger and interface. Simulators are a useful tool for studying computers and programs that run on them. Because these are implemented in software, they Can be easily modified to add new instructions.
              RISC-V architecture is simple and regular, which makes it easy to learn and understand. The processor contains 32 general purpose registers and a well-designed instruction set that make it a propitious target for generating code in a compiler.



RISCify FEATURES:

Our simulator supports the following RISC-V instructions 

          add
          sub
          bne
          beq
          lw
          sw
          lui
          j
          addi
          sll
          srl
          slt
          li
          la
          jal
          move
          jr 
          bge
          mul
          div
          ecall

Well sophisticated syntax error analyzer. It also points out the line in which the syntax got wrong

Simulator supports 4KB of Memory.


Simulator reads a .fsm file, analyzes it, executes it and print all the contents in the memory and registers.

It is software developed, so that it is easily modifiable, low budget, easy to carry simulator.
